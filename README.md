# test-console

Just some tests, and experiments, on standard io, stdout and stderr, in a SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS app... ie has WinMain() as OS entry point, rather than main() for a console app.

The idea if to find WIN32 kludge code to still be able to the console it is run in, if redirection is taking place...

I have called it a mess, on a mess, on a mess... maybe it is worse than that!
